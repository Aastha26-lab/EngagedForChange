          <h2>Call To Doctors To Work As Volunteers For COVID-19 Outbreak</h2>
          <div class="lessons">
          <p>The country is facing an unprecedented public health emergency with the COVID-19 pandemic affecting several parts of the nation.</p>
          <p>In case the outbreak leads to a high number of infected individuals, our public health facilities will face tremendous load to take care of the large number of patients. This overwhelming burden may not be met by the available doctors in the public health system.</p>
          <p>The Government of India requests for volunteer doctors who are fit and willing to be available for providing their services in the public health facilities and the training hospitals in the near future. We appeal to such doctors to come forward at this hour of need. You could also be a retired government, Armed Forces Medical Services, public sector undertaking or a private doctor.</p>

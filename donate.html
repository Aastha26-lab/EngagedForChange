      	<p>With so much uncertainty and concern surrounding the recent novel coronavirus, it’s easy to feel helpless—but there is something we can all do to help the fight against it. Aside from keeping safe and following guidelines from medical experts, we can all do our part to get help to people and regions that have been affected. </p>
        <p>By donating to a coronavirus relief fund, we can all do our part and provide much-needed support and aid. With the growing number of quarantined areas, individuals in these areas need vital medical help and day-to-day items to pull through this new threat.</p>
        <p>As the crisis grows, so do the negative effects on peoples’ health and their financial wellbeing, but we can all do our part to help those affected. Here’s how making a direct donation to COVID-19 fundraisers can help:</p>
        <p>LIVING EXPENSES: Hourly workers and people without paid sick time are among the most vulnerable to the negative financial effects of the pandemic. With no way to cover expenses, workers like these will inevitably fall behind on rent and other fixed expenses. For these reasons, it’s important to get ahead of the crisis and start providing support to individuals like these.</p>
        <p>FOOD, WATER, AND OTHER BASICS: Low-income households are already strained in good times but this new threat makes it even more important to provide immediate financial assistance to these households.</p>
